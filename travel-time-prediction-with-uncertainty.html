              Our project is designed to make travel planning smarter and more reliable by predicting road travel times with a clear understanding of uncertainty. Whether you're a commuter, a delivery operator, or a city planner, knowing how long a trip will take is essential—but traffic conditions, weather, and accidents can make predictions unreliable. This web application uses advanced AI to improve these predictions by not only forecasting travel times but also giving a confidence range for each estimate. That means you don't just get a single number—you see the best estimate along with how much it might vary depending on real-world conditions. This empowers users to make better decisions, like choosing the best time to leave or selecting alternative routes. Our goal is to help everyone—from everyday drivers to logistics companies—plan trips with greater peace of mind, avoid unnecessary delays, and improve overall transportation efficiency in our communities.

          <h2 class="section-title">How It Works</h2>
          <p class="content-text">
            Our system is powered by a <strong>Bayesian Neural Network with Monte Carlo Dropout</strong>, a cutting-edge AI approach that not only predicts travel times but also quantifies the uncertainty in those predictions. By performing multiple simulated forward passes, it generates both the expected travel time and the variability around it, delivering robust, data-driven results even in dynamic traffic conditions. Instead of giving you just one number, it offers a <strong>range of possible times</strong>, reflecting real-world unpredictability like traffic jams or weather changes. You can even adjust two key settings: <strong>uncertainty level</strong> and <strong>coverage level</strong>. The <strong>uncertainty level</strong> determines how wide that range should be—if you want to plan conservatively for all surprises, you can choose a higher level, giving you more time buffer. The <strong>coverage level</strong> sets how confident you want to be that your actual trip will fall within that range (for example, choosing 90% means you want to be 90% sure it'll be inside). By tuning these settings, you can balance being safe and being efficient, just like telling your navigator "give me the fastest time" or "plan with extra caution." This flexibility helps you make smarter travel decisions that match your personal comfort with risk and variability. The model is trained on over 20,000 historical travel time records collected via the Google Maps API, covering a network of cities throughout the Great Lakes region.
